This is the file thesis-umich.cls.
It provides a LaTeX class that is consistent with the guidelines
provided by the Rackham Graduate School as described at
<http://www.rackham.umich.edu/downloads/oard-dissertation-format-guidelines.pdf>

This class is based on the LaTeX template provided at <http://aoss.engin.umich.edu/pages/current/dissertation-template>

The correct usage of this template is to use it as a documentclass.
The first line of the .tex file should be
```LaTeX
\documentclass{thesis-umich}
```
if this file is in the same directory as the .tex file.  If the
two files are not in the same directory, the relative path from
the .tex file to this .cls file should be provided.  For example,
if the document is called thesis-dalle.tex and this file,
thesis-umich.cls is in a subfolder called 'tex', the command
should be
```LaTeX
\documentclass{./tex/thesis-umich}
```
An example is distributed with this file that demonstrates all
of the features of the template.  The example is in a file called
thesis-sample.tex.

## Comments from Umang
This is a LaTeX template that tries (but does not guarantee) to meet the requirements of the Rackham Graduate School at the University of Michigan.

I got this copy of the template from [Derek Dalle's webpage](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dalle/codes/thesis-umich/) and have modified it to remove various functionalities that can be found in standard LaTeX packages and added in code to address changes in the guidelines that Rackham posts.

Please make sure, of course, that you read Rackham's Handbook and formatting guidelines because they may change (or may become more strict about certain rules) over time.
